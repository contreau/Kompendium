# Kompendium

Kompendium is the digital preservation of Konrad's immense musical curation that he shared with countless friends, family and strangers over 11 years. Between 2013 and 2024, he crafted 826 original public Spotify playlists totaling 59,903 songs.

Nearly all of these playlists were crafted with a loving intent surrounding the listener, the location, and the music itself. Many were made to be directly paired with or for a particular person, group, location, time of day, or emotive state, to create an experience that is more than the sum of its parts.
